                    <p class="textmap">The map in The Witcher 3 is one of the largest maps in games. It is not an empty world; you can find a lot. The key feature of the "Wild Hunt" - a gigantic, open, and almost seamless world - turned out to be an incredible sham. Yes, its size is truly impressive, but what's the point when we are given very little per square meter. Additional quests are either on bulletin boards or scattered along the roads. What do you get from the vast expanses of the Northern Kingdoms besides alchemical ingredients? Expressive question marks that hide monster nests, hidden treasures, Places of Power, bandit/deserter camps, monster-infested buildings (clear it - and you get access to another merchant), and so on. The scheme is simple: saw a mark - went there - cleared it - all is well. You definitely won't come back to this place again. Balancing the local open world is achieved in the most primitive way: by tying to numbers. Forget the times when Geralt separately developed strength, agility, endurance, and intelligence. Now, numbers rule everything! Okay, you can reconcile yourself with the numbering of enemies (you can still defeat opponents with a difference of 3-10 levels, depending on your skill), but when a master of cutting and slashing can't even pick up a combat pick because it's level 2, not 4, you want to cry.</p>

It also exists with fundamental changes as a mini-game in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. In addition, there is a separate version of Gwent that differs from previous versions: Gwent: The Witcher Card Game.</summary>
